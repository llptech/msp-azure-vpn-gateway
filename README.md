# Microsoft Azure VPN Gateway Setup Guide

This guide provides an overview of configuring client computers and VPN appliances (future update) for connecting to Azure VPN Gateways. The guide is provided by LLP Technology as a resource for end users of active customers. However, the steps outlined here generally apply to any users of Azure VPN Gateway service.

## Choose Your Guide

We highly recommend using one of the *built-in* methods below. Using the Azure VPN Client is a convenient installation initially. However, if any changes to the VPN Gateway are required in the cloud, every end user will need to uninstall and reinstall the Azure VPN Client again to receive the updates. 

If you've previously installed the Azure VPN Client, you may uninstall it and follow the guide for setting up a new *built-in* VPN connection to avoid having to repeat the complete setup in the future.

**Built-in Connections**
- [Windows 10 Setup (Windows built-in)](./windows10-p2s-setup-manual.md)
- MacOS Setup (MacOS built-in) *future update*

**Azure VPN Client**
- Windows 10 Setup (Azure VPN Client) *future update*
